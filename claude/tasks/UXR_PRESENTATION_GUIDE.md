# UXR Presentation Guide
*Stakeholder communication strategy for research-driven decision making*

## Overview
This guide provides presentation strategy and scripts for communicating UXR findings to stakeholders. For foundational principles, reference `UXR_CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`. For technical implementation, see `UXR_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## Pre-Presentation Strategy

### **Audience Analysis**
- **Product/Engineering Leadership**: Focus on resource allocation and roadmap impact
- **Design Teams**: Emphasize user workflow patterns and pain points
- **Business Stakeholders**: Highlight customer evidence and competitive advantages
- **Technical Teams**: Show implementation priorities and technical debt implications

### **Decision Context Setup**
- Identify specific decisions that need to be made (resource allocation, feature prioritization, roadmap sequencing)
- Prepare evidence for anticipated objections or alternative viewpoints
- Have backup detail ready but start with high-level patterns

## 15-20 Minute Presentation Structure

### **Opening Hook (2 minutes)**
*Start with impact, not methodology*

**Template:**
> "We interviewed [X] customers about [workflow/process] and discovered something unexpected: **[Counter-intuitive insight that challenges assumptions]**."
> 
> "Today we'll look at two views of our research: the journey patterns that show us **what's universal vs divergent**, and the priority matrix that shows us **how to allocate our next [timeframe] of development**."

**Setup Action**: Navigate to journey map view

### **Act 1: Journey Patterns (8 minutes)**

#### **Universal Reality (2 minutes)**
**Show universal pattern indicators**
> "Here's what surprised us most - across [X] very different customers, **[Y] patterns are completely universal:**"
> - [List 3-4 universal patterns with brief impact description]

**Demo Action**: Click through universal pattern stages, show pattern descriptions

#### **Critical Attention Points (2 minutes)**
**Point to attention level indicators**
> "The journey shows us exactly where teams are struggling most. **[Specific stage]** is critical - it affects [customer coverage] daily."

**Demo Action**: Expand critical stages, show customer evidence quotes

#### **Meaningful Divergences (2 minutes)**
**Show hybrid/divergent patterns**
> "Not everything is universal. **[Context factor] drives [X] key divergences:**"
> - [List divergence points with business implications]

**Demo Action**: Expand divergent stages, show team variation data

#### **Customer Evidence Validation (2 minutes)**
**Point to customer coverage indicators**
> "Every insight here is backed by real customer evidence. Notice these **[X/Y] customer** indicators - these aren't edge cases."

**Demo Action**: Click on pain point, show customer evidence panel with specific quote

### **Act 2: Priority & Resource Allocation (8 minutes)**

#### **Navigate to Priority Matrix**
**Action**: Toggle to Priority Matrix view

#### **Priority Framework Introduction (2 minutes)**
> "We've organized [X] validated pain points using our established framework:"
> - **P1 ([%]): [Category description]** that [impact description]
> - **P2 ([%]): [Category description]** that [impact description]  
> - **P3 ([%]): [Category description]** that [impact description]

**Reference**: Point to quadrants, explain business logic positioning

#### **P1 Deep Dive (2 minutes)**
**Click on P1 items**
> "These [X] items block daily productivity for all customers:"
> [List P1 items with quantified impact]

**Demo Action**: Click on P1 item, show customer evidence and impact metrics

#### **P2 Growth Engine (3 minutes)**
**Highlight P2 items**
> "Here's where our assumptions were wrong. **These [X] P2 items are why [product] isn't scaling:**"

**Adoption Barriers Section:**
> [List adoption-related P2 items with evidence]

**Integration Challenges Section:**
> [List integration-related P2 items with evidence]

**Demo Action**: Click on key P2 item, show enterprise customer abandonment evidence

#### **Resource Allocation Reality (1 minute)**
**Point to initiative categories**
> "This gives us clear resource allocation guidance:"
> [Summarize P1/P2/P3 distribution and business rationale]

### **Act 3: Decision Time (5 minutes)**

#### **Strategic Choice Point (2 minutes)**
> "Based on this research, we have a strategic choice:"
> 
> **Option A: [Focus description]**
> - [Benefits and limitations]
> - **Risk**: [Primary risk]
> 
> **Option B: [Balanced approach description]**  
> - [Benefits and approach]
> - **Recommendation**: This is what the data supports

#### **Proposed Resource Strategy (2 minutes)**
> "I recommend a **[X/Y] split** for the next [timeframe]:"
> - **[X]% on P1**: [Specific items and rationale]
> - **[Y]% on P2**: [Specific items and rationale]
> 
> "This [achieves current goals] while [enabling future goals]."

#### **Next Steps & Validation (1 minute)**
> **Immediate Actions:**
> 1. **[Decision 1]** - [specific question for group]
> 2. **[Decision 2]** - [specific question for group]  
> 3. **[Decision 3]** - [specific question for group]

## Demo Navigation Best Practices

### **Control Strategy**
- **Default to Priority Matrix**: More immediately actionable than journey
- **Use Journey for Context**: When priorities are questioned, return to journey evidence
- **Click Sparingly**: Only when adding specific evidence or insight
- **Stay in Control**: Don't let demo become exploration session

### **Audience Engagement**
- **Watch for Confusion**: If people look lost, simplify or return to basics
- **Encourage Questions**: But timebox exploration - you're driving to decisions
- **Acknowledge Challenges**: Don't oversell - recognize implementation complexity
- **Reference Framework**: When challenged, point back to established principles

## Q&A Preparation

### **Common Questions & Responses**

#### **"Why is [item] P2 instead of P3/P4?"**
Template: "Because it's a **[growth/adoption] blocker, not just a [preference/optimization]**. When [specific behavior], it indicates [fundamental problem]. We can't [business goal] if [negative outcome]."

#### **"How confident are we in these priorities?"**
Template: "Every priority is backed by [evidence type]. The P1 items affect [coverage] customers [frequency]. The P2 items are [specific risk description]."

#### **"What if we only focus on P1?"**
Template: "We'll [achieve immediate goal] but won't solve why [adoption/scaling problem]. [Specific customer] specifically mentioned [abandonment/risk] due to P2 issues."

#### **"Timeline for implementation?"**
Template: "P1 items could be addressed in [timeframe]. P2 [category] need [timeframe]. The research shows P2 can't wait - these are [risk type] issues."

#### **"Sample size concerns?"**
Template: "[X] customers across [Y] different [context types]. Universal patterns appeared in all [X]. Divergent patterns were consistent within [context] types."

## Post-Presentation Actions

### **Immediate Follow-up (within 24 hours)**
- [ ] Send presentation export and key customer quotes
- [ ] Document decisions made and any disagreements  
- [ ] Schedule follow-up sessions for deep dives on agreed priorities

### **Decision Validation (within 1 week)**
- [ ] Confirm resource allocation with implementation teams
- [ ] Identify any additional research needed for priority items
- [ ] Establish success metrics for chosen initiatives

### **Progress Tracking (ongoing)**
- [ ] Regular check-ins on P1 implementation progress
- [ ] Periodic review of P2 barrier status
- [ ] Customer feedback validation on improvements made

## Success Indicators

### **During Presentation**
- **Engagement**: Questions about implementation, not explanation of research
- **Decision Focus**: Conversation moves toward resource allocation
- **Evidence Acceptance**: Stakeholders reference customer quotes in their responses

### **Post-Presentation**
- **Roadmap Changes**: Actual priority shifts in development planning
- **Resource Commitment**: Specific team/time allocation to identified priorities  
- **Follow-through**: Scheduled implementation discussions within one week

## Presentation Flow Timing

### **Recommended Pace**
- **Don't Rush Setup**: Hook and context deserve full 2 minutes
- **Let Patterns Sink In**: Journey walkthrough needs full 8 minutes for absorption
- **Drive to Decisions**: Priority section is where business outcomes happen
- **Force Commitments**: Don't end without specific next steps

### **Flexibility Guidelines**
- **Compress Journey if Needed**: But never skip universal patterns
- **Expand P2 Discussion**: If adoption questions arise, this is your evidence
- **Always Reserve Time**: For decision-making at the end
